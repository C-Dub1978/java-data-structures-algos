SelectionSort -

Divides the array into sorted and unsorted partitions, just like bubble sort

Fields:
lastUnsortedIndex (array length - 1 default) = last index of the unsorted partition
i (1 default) = index to traverse the array left to right (for ascending)
largest (0 default) = index of largest value in the unsorted partition

We traverse the array and find the largest element in the unsorted partition, and then we swap that with the last element in the unsorted partition - at that point, the last element
will be in its proper partition.

Pseudo -
1. lastUnsorted index is length of array - 1;
2. i = 0
3. largest = 0;

4. while i <= lastSortedIndex
  a. check to see if value of i is greater than largest, if true, set largest to i - i++ to move to next index
  b. continue until we get to lastSortedIndex - swap lastSorted index value with largest value
5. lastSortedIndex --;
6. continue this traversal until lastSortedIndex is index 1, swap if needed
